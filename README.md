# Prometheus Exporter for IMGW-PIB (Institute of Meteorology and Water Management)

This project is a **Prometheus Exporter for IMGW-PIB** designed to collect and expose meteorological and hydrological data from the **Institute of Meteorology and Water Management - National Research Institute (IMGW-PIB)**. The exporter fetches real-time data provided by IMGW on weather conditions, water levels, and other environmental metrics across Poland, making this information available for monitoring and alerting in Prometheus.

Key features:
+ **Data Sources**: Collects data from IMGW's public API, including meteorological observations, water levels, temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and more.
+ **Metrics Exposure**: Exposes the collected data in a format compatible with Prometheus, allowing seamless integration with Grafana and other monitoring tools.
+ **Customizable Queries**: Allows users to specify the regions, stations, and types of data they wish to monitor, enabling targeted and efficient data collection.
+ **Alerting Capabilities**: Integrated with Prometheusâ€™ alerting rules, enabling users to set up notifications for extreme weather conditions or critical environmental changes.

This project aims to provide a reliable and efficient way to monitor weather and water data in Poland, enhancing observability for research, environmental monitoring, and disaster preparedness efforts.
